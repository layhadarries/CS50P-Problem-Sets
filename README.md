# CS50P-Problem-Sets

All problem sets submitted for the Harvard CS50P Course and a personal log of my growth, reflections, and progress throughout.


Week 0:

Topics covered:  Git, Visual Studio Code, Functions, Variables, Return Values, Side Effects and String Methods.

What I've Learned:
Foundational programming concepts and tools. I learned how to use Git for version control and how to navigate and write code using Visual Studio Code. I also gained a clearer understanding of functions in Python. How they work, how to define them, return values versus side effects, and how to manipulate strings using built-in methods.

Challenges I've Faced:
Initially, Git was a bit confusing. Lot's of new terms to remember but the operation or application of it was fairly simple. Understanding the purpose of commits, pushes, and clones took time to sink in. Additionally, I caught myself overcomplicating problems, which slowed down my progress.

Confident Areas:
I'm becoming comfortable with writing simple Python functions and using variables to store and manipulate data. I'm also gaining confidence in reading documentation to explore Python's built-in tools.

Reflections:
Starting this course reminded me of how rewarding it feels to build things from scratch. Even basic programs gave me a sense of progress. I'm learning break problems into steps, and test as I go. The support materials and lectures have been really engaging and made learning feel structured as well as flexible.

Looking Ahead:
Things I Still Want to Improve:
- Deepen my understanding of version control and get more practice with Git and GitHub workflows
- I want to improve my debugging process and get used to using breakpoints or print statements strategically to catch errors early
